## What is WoWmapper

WoWmapper is part of a project aimed at bringing true controller functionality to World of Warcraft.
It handles connections from DualShock 4 or Xbox/Xinput devices and converts them into button presses and mouse movements,
which are then sent to WoW and processed by [ConsolePort, an addon for World of Warcraft](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info23536-ConsolePort.html).
ConsolePort binds each key to an action within World of Warcraft, and features a full UI and many features for
enhanced gameplay with a controller.

## What do I need?

- A system running Windows 7, 8, 10 or higher.
- DirectX 9 or DirectX 10.
- A compatible controller (DualShock 4 or Xbox compatible only)
- World of Warcraft

## How much effort is required to set it up?
 
Practically none at all. Once you have started WoWmapper, and loaded World of Warcraft, it will automatically export your configuration to ConsolePort, setting up
the appropriate keybinds and modifier keys. Once in-game, you can simply load the default controller configuration for a quick and
simple set up, or customize the controls further as you feel necessary.

## How do I change what the buttons do?

To access your controller configuration in game, open the system menu and select Controller, or type

```
/cp binds
```

into the chat box and press Enter.
