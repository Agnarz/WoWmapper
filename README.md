WoWmapper is a game controller input mapper for World of Warcraft, designed for use with the addon [ConsolePort by MunkDev](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info23536-ConsolePort-GameControllerAddon.html). It provides standard keyboard mapping support as well as various other features designed to make gameplay with a controller easier.

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- [Microsoft DirectX](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/179113)
- [Microsoft .NET Framework v4.5.2 (or later)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=42643)
- [World of Warcraft](http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/)
- [ConsolePort by MunkDev](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info23536-ConsolePort-GameControllerAddon.html)

### Installing WoWmapper

Download WoWmapper from [here](https://github.com/topher-au/WoWmapper/releases/latest). WoWmapper is provided as an installer as well as a standard ZIP archive. Once you have downloaded and installed the application, start it by selecting WoWmapper from the Start menu, or by running *WoWmapper.exe* from the application folder.

The first time you run WoWmapper, it will attempt to locate your World of Warcraft installation directory. If this is unsuccessful, you can select your World of Warcraft directory from the Settings window. If you do not select a directory, WoWmapper will be unable to update ConsolePort.

WoWmapper comes pre-configured for use with ConsolePort. If you wish to change the bindings, they can be accessed from the Settings window, or by right-clicking the system tray icon.

### Selecting a controller

WoWmapper supports DualShock 4 and Xbox 360 controllers, and will automatically bind to the first available if one is detected. You can manually select the controller from the Settings menu, under Controllers.

## Advanced Features
WoWmapper can optionally provide some extra features, such as vibration and lightbar feedback, by reading some of the game's memory. For more details on this feature, please see [here](https://github.com/topher-au/WoWmapper/wiki/Advanced-Features).
