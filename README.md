# DS4ConsolePort

DS4ConsolePort is a DualShock4 input layer for World of Warcraft, designed for use with the addon [ConsolePort by MunkDev](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info23536-ConsolePort-GameControllerAddon.html).

## Getting Started

Easy to set up and use, simply download the latest release (or build your own) and run it. The DS4 will be automatically detected if present.

You can rebind the buttons as needed from the Keybinds tab. The recommended/default configuration is F1-F12 and Numpad * (PS), Numpad - (TouchLeft) and  Numpad + (TouchRight).

From the Advanced tab, you can enable the Advanced Haptics module.

## Advanced Haptics

The advanced haptics module uses passive memory reading (no injection) to read some basic information about your character, such as name, class and health.

Using this kind of technique is a violation of the World of Warcraft terms of service, however I believe that it cannot be detected in any way, nor are Blizzard likely to ban you if it were.
